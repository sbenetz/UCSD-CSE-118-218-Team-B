## WEMOS Lolin D32 Controller
This board runs the part of our system that has to do with the actual plant monitoring.
We use this board to read soil moisture and sunlight, send that info to our server,
then receive signals from the server of when to water. We also use the bluetooth ability
of this device to setup the device via connection to a personal mobile device.
